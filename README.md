I’m @Dradon7
- 16 year old, terrible at coding, amazing at smashing together other people's code to do what I want (don't worry, I give credit and check lisenses)
- I’m interested in minecraft modding, and modpack creation
- I’m currently learning java, which is significantly harder than python
- When I start doing serious work, I'll probably change this to make me not seem immature
